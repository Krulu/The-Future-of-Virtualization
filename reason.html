    <h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="fly-col">
            <h3>EFFICIENCY AND RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION</h3>
            <p>Technology called "Virtualization" lets many pretend computers live together on one real-life machine.
                This makes the best use of all resources in a single device, and gets us the most out of it. This works
                better and makes the computer costs less, uses up energy in a small way. It is good for nature too. As
                businesses and people work for something that can last long and be good at making money, using programs to
                create computer systems without the need of a lot of real-world things is becoming very important in helping
                build up resources we use.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fly-col">
            <h3>CLOUD COMPUTING REVOLUTION</h3>
            <p> The start of using cloud computing has been very connected to the technology known as virtualization.
                This helped make it easy for resources to be given out quickly when needed in big systems and networks
                that support a large number of people online with many different programs, apps and websites all at once
                working together through servers spread around the globe interconnected digitally. The big and bendable parts
                of fake computer setups make the base for building stuff on clouds. These are built using simple words in everyday
                English that anyone can easily understand. With more people wanting to use cloud services, the need for virtualization
                is increasing. It will be important in helping make digital services fast and big enough for future needs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fly-col">
            <h3>SECURITY AND ISOLATION</h3>
            <p>
                Using virtualization makes things more secure. It gives separate spaces for software
                and tasks to run safe from each other. This separation aids in experiencing and dealing with security breaks,
                which makes computer systems using less real things much more strong. As our online threats get more tricky,
                the strong security tools of virtualization make it important for keeping us safe in future.

            <h3>AGILE DEVELOPMENT AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT</h3>
            <p>Virtualization speeds up software making and putting it to use. Developers have reliable places where
                they can test things out many times if needed. This speed is very important in a quick technology world.
                It lets groups reply quickly to what the market wants and use new updates easily. In the future, what makes
                things move quick and easy will help new ideas grow. It's also important for keeping ahead of others in business
                or industries where success happens fast by using virtualization technology well.</p>

        <div class="fly-col">
            <h3>DESKTOP VIRTUALIZATION AND REMOTE WORK</h3>
            <p>The concept of virtual desktops is gaining prominence, enabling users to access their personalized
                desktop environments from any device. This not only simplifies device management but also contributes
                to the growing trend of remote work. As the boundaries between physical and virtual workspaces blur,
                virtualization is poised to redefine the way we collaborate and access information.</p>

        <div class="fly-col">
            <h3>INNOVATIONS IN EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
            <p>Virtualization is set to play a crucial role in emerging technologies such as edge computing, Internet of Things (IoT),
                and artificial intelligence. The ability to create and manage virtual environments becomes paramount in
                distributed computing scenarios,paving the way for groundbreaking applications in smart cities,
                autonomous systems, and more
